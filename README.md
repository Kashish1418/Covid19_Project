# Covid19_Project
This Project is about Covid19.
This Project focuses on a pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan, China. It was first internationally reported from China on 31 December 2019. Today we know this virus as Coronavirus. COVID-19 which stands for CORONAVIRUS Disease is the disease caused by this Virus. Since then, the world has been engaged in the fight against this pandemic. Several measures have therefore been taken to "flatten the curve". We have consequently experienced social distancing and many people have passed away as well.

In this Project, we use a dataset, from Kaggle.
