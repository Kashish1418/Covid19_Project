# Covid19_Project (Using R programming Language)
## Objective
The objective of a COVID-19 Data Analysis Project typically revolves around using data to understand the impact of the virus, track its spread, and provide actionable insights for decision-making.

## Questions
The purpose of this Project is to provide an answer to this question: 
- Which countries have reported the highest number of positive cases in relation to the number of tests conducted?
- Which countries have had the highest fatality (mortality) rates?
- Which countries have had the highest number of positive cases against the number of tests?
- Which countries were ultimately the most and least affected related to their population?

## Answers
- "Death" = death_top_3,
- "Positive tested cases" = positive_tested_top_3,
- "The Best effort in test related to the population" = best_effort_tested_cased_top_3,
- "The most affected country related to its population" = most_affected_country,
- "The least affected country related to its population" = least_affected_country

## Introduction
This Project focuses on a pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan, China. It was first internationally reported from China on 31 December 2019. Today we know this virus as Coronavirus. COVID-19 which stands for CORONAVIRUS Disease is the disease caused by this Virus. Since then, the world has been engaged in the fight against this pandemic. Several measures have therefore been taken to "flatten the curve". We have consequently experienced social distancing and many people have passed away as well.

## Dataset Used 
In this Project, I use a dataset, from Kaggle. This dataset was collected between the 20th of January and the 1st of June 2020.
